# SMS_via_SMTP
## Simple Mail Spammer(SMS) via Simple Mail Transfer Protocol(SMTP)
The script is to send n number of emails to a target with some trash message (to be modified further)... <br>
The script does it by opening a secure openssl connection to GSMTP <br>
Google only accepts the credentials in base64 and TLS connection<br>
Tip: Might need to turn on less secure apps access on your google account

### Requirements
#!/usr/bin/expect -> (Still in doubt if it exists by default) <br>
`sudo apt-get install expect`
### Usage
./maalik_mail_1.sh
