# SMS_via_SMTP
## Simple Mail Spammer(SMS) via Simple Mail Transfer Protocol(SMTP)
The script is expected to send n number of emails to a target with some 1 liner trash message (to be modified further)... <br>

Google only accepts the credentials in base64 and TLS connection<br>
A simple explanation can be found in GSMTP file

`sudo apt-get install expect`
